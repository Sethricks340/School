The activities of the Division integrate device research with basic materials investigations and with systems research and development needs.</p>
										
										<p>The Center for Bio/Molecular Science and Engineering is using the tools of modern biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering to develop advanced materials and sensors. The long-term research goal is first to gain a fundamental understanding of the relationship between molecular architecture and the function of materials, then apply this knowledge to solve problems for the Navy and Department of Defense community. The key theme is the study of complex bio/ molecular systems with the aim of understanding how “nature” has approached the solution of difficult structural and sensing problems. Technological areas currently being studied include molecular and microstructure design, molecular biology, self-assembly, controlled release and encapsulation, and surface patterning and modification. Much of the research deals with the self-assembly of lipids, proteins, and liquid crystals into complex microstructures for use in advanced material applications, and the harnessing of the recognition functions of proteins and cells for the development of advanced sensors. A highly multidisciplinary staff is required to pursue these research and development programs. The Center provides a stimulating environment for cross-disciplinary programs in the areas of immunology, biochemistry, electrochemistry, inorganic and polymer chemistry, microbiology, microlithography, photochemistry, biophysics, spectroscopy, advanced diagnostics, organic synthesis, and electro-optical engineering.</p>
										
										<p>The Acoustics Division conducts basic and applied research addressing the physics of acoustic signal generation, propagation, scatter, and detection with the objective of improving the strategic and tactical capabilities of the Navy and Marine Corps in the ocean and land operational environment. The Division’s scientists and engineers perform collaborative research with scientists affiliated with national and international academic, private, and governmental research organizations. The Division’s research spans classical and quantum physics, signal processing, the impact of fluid dynamics on the ocean sound speed field, the propagation and scatter of acoustic signals in the ocean and land environments, structural and physical acoustics including the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology based sensors, and the application of networked unmanned underwater vehicles and associated sensors to the Navy’s antisubmarine warfare, mine countermeasures, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions.</p>
										
										<p>The Remote Sensing Division conducts a program of basic and applied research aimed at the development of new concepts for sensors and imaging systems for objects and targets on Earth, in the near-Earth environment, and in deep space. The research, both theoretical and experimental, deals with discovering and understanding the basic physical principles and mechanisms that give rise to target and background emission and to absorption and emission by the intervening medium. The accomplishment of this research requires the development of sensor systems technology. This development effort includes active and passive sensor systems to be used for the study and analysis of the physical characteristics of phenomena that give rise to naturally occurring background radiation, such as that caused by Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, as well as human-made or induced phenomena, such as ship/submarine hydrodynamic effects. The research includes theory, laboratory, and field experiments leading to ground-based, airborne, and space-based systems for use in such areas as environmental remote sensing (including improved meteorological support systems for the operational Navy), astrometry, astrophysics, surveillance, and nonacoustic antisubmarine warfare. Special emphasis is given to developing space-based platforms and exploiting existing space systems.</p>
										
										<p>The Space Science Division conducts a broad-spectrum research, development, test, and evaluation program in solar-terrestrial physics, astrophysics, upper/middle atmospheric science, and astronomy. Division researchers develop instruments to be flown on satellites, sounding rockets, and balloons; specialized ground-based facilities; and mathematical models. Researchers apply these and other capabilities to the study of the atmospheres of the Sun and Earth, including solar activity and its effects on Earth’s ionosphere, upper atmosphere, and middle atmosphere; laboratory astrophysics; and the unique physics and properties of celestial sources. The science is important to orbital tracking, radio communications, and navigation that affect the operation of ships and aircraft; utilization of the near-space and space environment of the Earth; and the fundamental understanding of natural radiation and geophysical phenomena.</p>
										
										<p>The Space Systems Development Department (SSDD) is the space and ground support systems research and development organization of NRL’s Naval Center for Space Technology. The primary objective of the SSDD is to develop command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance hardware and software solutions to space, airborne, and ground applications to respond to Navy, Department of Defense, and national mission requirements with improved performance, capacity, reliability, efficiency, and/or life cycle cost. The Department must derive system requirements from the mission, develop architectures in response to these requirements, and design and develop systems, subsystems, equipment, and implementation technologies to achieve the optimized, integrated operational space, airborne, and ground system. These development responsibilities extend across the entire space/airborne/ground spectrum of hardware, software, and advanced technologies, including digital processing and control, analog systems, power, communications, payload command and telemetry, radio frequency, optical, payload, and electromechanical systems, as well as systems engineering.</p>
										
										<p>The Spacecraft Engineering Department (SED) is the focal point for the Navy’s capability to design and build spacecraft. Activities range from concept and feasibility planning to on-orbit initial operational capability for NRL’s space systems. The SED provides spacecraft bus expertise for the Navy and maintains an active in-house capability to develop satellites; manages Navy space programs through engineering support and technical direction; in concert with the Space Systems Development Department, designs, assembles, and tests spacecraft and space experiments, including all aspects of space, launch, and ground support; analyzes and designs structures, mechanisms, and a variety of control systems, including attitude, propulsion, reaction, and thermal; integrates satellite designs, launch vehicles, and satellite-to-boost stages; and functions as a prototype laboratory to ensure that designs can be transferred to industry and incorporated into subsequent satellite hardware builds.</p>
