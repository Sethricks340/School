# Recursion
The concept of recursion is that a function is calling itself, inside of itself. Here is a super basic (and super bad) example of recursion:

```csharp
public void RecursiveFunction(int x){
    Console.WriteLine(x);
    x += 1;
    RecursiveFunction(x);
}
```
Can you see why this would be problematic? When you call this function, it has no way to end! It will continue going until you run out of memory, or the universe ends. Whichever comes first. To fix this, we need to define a 
**base case**. A base case is where we will return out of the function given a certain condition is true. Let's go 
ahead and fix our function with a base case.

```csharp
public void RecursiveFunction(int x){
    Console.WriteLine(x);
    //base case: don't call function again if x is 10 or greater
    if (x < 10){
        x += 1;
        RecursiveFunction(x);
    }
}
//Output if we call RecursiveFunction(5);
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
// 10
```
That's recursion!
