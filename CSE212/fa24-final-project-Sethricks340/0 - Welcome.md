Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. This tutorial goes over the following:
* [Stack](https://github.com/byui-cse212/fa24-final-project-Sethricks340/blob/main/1%20-%20Stack.md)
* [Linked List](https://github.com/byui-cse212/fa24-final-project-Sethricks340/blob/main/2%20-%20Linked%20List.md)
* [Tree](https://github.com/byui-cse212/fa24-final-project-Sethricks340/blob/main/3%20-%20Tree.md)

Each of these explains what the data structure is, and gives examples. There is also a problem given to you at the end for you to try to solve on your own. Don't look at the solution for the problem until you have tried the problem yourself.
